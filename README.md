# sharts, round two
### this time with node! :/

An online hearts/card game server, brought to you by [socket.io](http://socket.io).

The foundation for this code, helping me solve the problem of telling how many people are online at any given moment, can be found [here](https://github.com/socketio/chat-example).

#### To run:
You'll need `express` and `socket.io`, and obviously node (again, :/ ).
Then, a quick `node index.js` should get this running on `localhost:3000`.
